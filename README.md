This plugin was originally developed during DevCamp in MoodlemootDACH 2025 by:
Marina Glancy, Jan Britz,  Immanuel Pasanec, Vasco Grossmann, Lars Dreier, Kathleen Aermes and Monika Weber.

We use [tool_realtime](https://github.com/marinaglancy/moodle-tool_realtime) with an additional plugins for bi-directional websockets.

We demoed it during the DevCamp and had 70 people playing it at the same time.

Plugin is still in early development and not ready for production use.
